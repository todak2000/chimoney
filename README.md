## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20
- npm/yarn
- Firebase account which allows you create a firebase project. see [setup here](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-nextjs#0)
- TypeScript
- Chimoney Sandbox Developer account which allows you to create and access the enpoints with provided Keys/secrets. see [details here](https://chimoney.readme.io/reference/introduction)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/todak2000/chimoney.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```
cd chimoney
yarn install
```

3. Set up your Firebase configuration in a `.env` file. - see `.env.example` as example env file for your reference

4. With the assumption that you have created your Chimoney sand box account, you add your api key to the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHIMONEY_API_KEY` variable in the `.env` file. You can as well add a redirect url, this is important when implementing card payment as well as generating payment links for users.

## Development

6. Run Test if you so wish. Jest was used to implement unit Tests. see `__tests__` to run full test on all components. Run the following command:

```
yarn test
```

For specific components. Run the following command:

```
yarn test __tests__/unit/<TESTFILE>
```

e.g.`yarn test __tests__/unit/NotFound.test.tsx` where `<TESTFILE>` = `NotFound.test.tsx`.

7. Start the server in development mode:

```
yarn dev
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

Being a NextJS app which allows for both client and server side development, endpoints required to create, read, delete, update respective features can be found in `src/app/api` folder. Basically, Firebase (Database and Authentication), React Query (fetching, caching, and updating data) was used to build performant endpoints from chimoney - see documentation here `https://api-v2-sandbox.chimoney.io` . There are two subfolders `auth` and `other` which are apis for firebase google authentication and chimoney respectively. These endpoints were most used in different customized hooks here `src/app/hooks/index.ts`. For instance, the `useGetUserChimoneyDetails` hook referenced the `getAccountDetails` endpoint which allows for seamless querying of user data from chimoney while cross checking with firebase database as well - see `useAuthStateChange` for details.

## CI/CD and Deployment

This app was set up using CircleCI pipeline which allows for seamless transition of codebase to production artifacts as well as deployed to vercel. Only upon successful setup does it deploys to vercel
